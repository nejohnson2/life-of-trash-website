	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> In my never-end quest to understand the world of trash, I decided to uncover exactly what happens to the waste at New York University.  After several weeks of pestering the NYU Sustainability Office without any good answers, it was finally discovered that Action Environmental Service was responsible for collecting NYU's waste and recycling.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> With great joy and enthusiasm, I navigated various contacts within the university to organize a trip to an Action facility. </p>	

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> Finally, at approximately 1:16pm, after six hours of traveling, the phone sent its final coordinate.  Following this information, no other communication was heard from the phone suggesting a final destruction of the phone.  The quest to discover where the phone had ended then began.</p>

	<h1>Sophisticatedly Simple</h1>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> After several days had passed, it was decided that nothing more was going to be received from the phone.  It was then that I began my journey to document exactly where the phone had traveled.  From the map that was created by the real time updating of the phone, one could see that the last location of the phone was somewhere near the John Jay Byrne bridge on the border between northern Brooklyn and Queens.  </p>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> Upon arriving at the John Jay Byrne bridge, it was obvious that this part of the city is the industrial area of the city which facilitates many of the services provided by the city.  </p>
	
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> As I passed over the bridge and arrived at the last coordinate received, it was clear that discovering the phone again would be an impossibility as well as clearly identifying its path during the final hour of its existence.  The final coordinate of the phone rested in a seemingly abandoned lot surrounded by a metallic fence and razor wire preventing anyone from entering. </p>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> By finding the gated entrance to the lot, I was able to take a few photos through the space in the gate to try and provide some type of understanding as to what lay inside.</p>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> Unfortunately, no other information as to where the phone finally rested was able to be discovered.  At this point, I can only speculate to say that perhaps the phone was disregarded into the dumpster that exists in the center of the abandoned lot.  Based on the final coordinate, this is the only visual evidence that can be provided.

	<h1>Truck Tracking</h1>	
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> After attempting to identify the final resting place of the phone, I began to backtrack other locations the phone had been signaling.  During this journey, I was meet with two dump trucks passing down a one way street.  These trucks were clearly labeled as Department of Sanitation trucks, so I decided to follow their current journey. </p>

   	<img style="

    margin-right: auto; " src="/img/ActionVisit/avisit6.jpg">   	<br>	

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> After a few minutes of travel, the trucks arrived at a secluded and unmarked street in the same industrial area the phone had visited during its final hour.  Following them down this street, we arrived at a dumping station which restricted access to private personnel.  A line of trucks had accumulated at this entrance which seemed to signal some type of weighing station. </p>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;">Later after physically visiting these site, I plotted the same coordinates in Google Earth to try and get another view on these locations.  Indeed, Google Earth had confirmed everything I had seen and provided more detail to understand this drop-off station.  As seen in these images from Google Earth, there is an area which allows trucks to dump their trash, and then move the trash onto a barge which is adjacent.

	<h1>Conclusions</h1>
        
	<p class="lead" style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;"> Overall the first phone launch was incredibly successful.  Though its total travel time was a little over 6 hours, visualizing its path through the city has been extremely informative.  Technologically speaking, the system in place worked perfectly and captured trash activity over the course of an after noon.  Moving forward, the plan is to create version two of the application and backend structure to allow the deployment of multiple phones simultaneously.  Viewing the path of several pieces of trash should allow an even more profound understanding of where trash goes once its been collected.   <br>
